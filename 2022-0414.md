## Diary of a programmer day 2022-04-14

I discussed a few times with colleagues how to do the right things in golang... One of the strange things for programmers coming from languages like Java or C# is that there are no exceptions, and we have to use a lot of "if"s... A good technique like omitting this is "catching" panics.
go
### Solution for this problem:
Suppose your function has to work with a few resources like database connection, calling a few REST APIs, and opening some streams. In that case, you have to check the return values for each opened resource and the operation that it was processed correctly.

Finally, your code can have many folding "if" statements and complexity is growing.

A good practice is to create a simple "defer" statement in a function that collects "panics" raised in the function, and then we can create a similar flow in your code, like with exceptions and try/catch/finally statements.
There is an example:

```go
func somethingSend() (ret bool) {
	// exception handling
	defer func() {
		if r := recover(); r != nil {
			err := r.(error)
			log.Error("log error: ", err)
			ret = false // and return false
		}
	}()

	ret = false
	if err := func1(); err != nil {
    panic err
  }

  // any logic there
  // ...

  if err := func2(); err != nil {
    panic err
  }

  // any logic there
  // ...

	if err := func3(); err != nil {
    panic err
  }
  
  // any logic there
  // ...

  ret = true
  return
}
```
