## Diary of a programmer day 2022-05-02

Another good technique which is good to know in golang - for folks starting in golang and searching right Solution - is how to control asynchronous processes.
Please don't fall into some sophisticated "signal" variable hell or something like that - we have channels in golang for this. Personally, for me, channels are one of the most powerful things in golang.

### Solution for this problem:
Suppose your application uses some asynchronous task, and you want to have some control over this task. It means that you want to start it asynchronously and create a nice thread for it - no problem - in golang, we can call 'go func', and that's it.

But how to stop it? We need a channel - to send the signal to your asynchronous thread that it will stop.
In the example, the simple asynchronous function prints something on stdout every one second and in the main thread is prepared after some timeout stopping signal.

There is an example:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

var cancelLoop chan bool

func asyncLoop() {
	for {
		select {
		case <-cancelLoop:
			fmt.Println("task canceled!")
			return
		case <-time.After(600 * time.Millisecond):
			fmt.Println("task timeout")
		}
	}
}

func main() {
	cancelLoop = make(chan bool)
	fmt.Println("start ..")
	go asyncLoop()
	time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)
	fmt.Println("send cancel ..")
  // and there is the cancel of async func!
	cancelLoop <- true
	time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
	fmt.Println("end ..")
}
```
