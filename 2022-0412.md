## Diary of a programmer day 2022-04-12

The task for today: deploy react application (static web) to S3 but expose it to the internet via external service in EKS and Application Load Balancer.

### Problem description:
Because our solution is based on microservices and each customer has their own instances of microservice backends, we have to use some mechanism to deploy front-ends, retain versions, and serve to customers appropriate front-end versions.

### Idea behind:
All customer instances are running in the EKS Kubernetes cluster, separated by namespaces and network rules. EKS has one  Application Load Balancer, which acts as a super front-end ingress controller and sends all traffic to the internal Nginx ingress controller.

Detail routing rules are managed only by internal Nginx ingress.

The web application is deployed to S3 because it is a static react website. Therefore, there is created folders per application version in S3 bucket. 

And now key point - we want to "mount" to each customer expected version front-end, it means some customers are sharing version 1 and some "beta testers" are sharing, for example, version 2. But how to configure it in the right way?

### Solution:
Few challenges:
* How to create an external service in Kubernetes to point to S3?
* How to configure ingress to send the right Host headers?

Finally, it works in this configuration:
* S3 with VPCE (virtual network endpoint) and custom policy to enable anonymous access only from VPC
* S3 is configured like the static website to be able to set the rule that path "/" means "/index.html"
* External service in each customer's namespace.
* Ingress in each customer's namespace, which points to S3.
