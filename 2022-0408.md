## Diary of a programmer day 2022-04-08

Today I'm again trying to figure out why a connection is not stable when one nebula mesh network is routed over another nebula mesh network.

### Problem description:
Slack's nebula communication sent via another established underlay communication channel (like another nebula) is not working correctly. Even TCP/IP is not stable because we are losing packets or receiving packets in a different order.

### Trying to figure out:
Because we have to send traffic via an underlay network connection on WebSockets to be able to communicate on networks where the UDP protocol required by nebula is not working, we have to solve how to route traffic. 

In fact, one nebula connection is used like an anonymisation proxy which sends traffic to the point where UDP traffic is working correctly. And then, via routing rules, the traffic of our "regular" nebula flows via this anonymisation tunnel.

But in this case, the connection is unstable! What happens there? I investigated communication with Wireshark, and finally, the "BAD" thing is MTU size! 

And one other funny thing: most problems appear on the Windows platform with a combination of the WSL 2.0 subsystem (I am lucky that I am trying a solution on this combination!).

### Few challenges:
* How to finetune MTU sizes for underlay nebula and regular nebula?
* Can we use some standard configuration mechanism for it?
