## Diary of a programmer day 2022-04-20

Today I'm again trying to implement nebula mesh over restrictive networks like some WiFi in banks or coffee shops or even some telco operator networks with restrictive NAT rules.

### Problem description:
Slack's nebula (mesh network uses UDP communication and hole punching technology to establish peer to peer communication between nodes in the mesh. But if there is a restriction and UDP cannot be used nebula itself is not working anymore.

### Final working solution:
Our shieldoo mesh is referencing nebula packages - we are not using binaries; what I have in mind is this construct:
Create an underlay nebula network (in fact, nebula over nebula). Underlay network acts as anonymisation proxy which routes all traffic over internet node. But the thing which I had to finetune was MTU - message transfer unit size for network layers. Finally, there is a working stack:
Underlay WebSocket proxy for UDP packets is implemented in go (on both sides - client and server) - my inspiration comes from a great wstunnel application: https://github.com/erebe/wstunnel
Underlay nebula network has MTU set to 1300 bytes (nebula standard, in fact)
Regular nebula network has MTU set to 1240 bytes to have space for network frames and UDP envelope overhead.
With this setup, we can run our shieldoo mesh client (with nebula inside) even over a network where is enabled only HTTPS and in fact, we are ready to use proxies (not implemented yet).
