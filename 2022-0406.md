## Diary of a programmer day 2022-04-06

Today I'm again trying to figure out how to make nebula mesh works on restrictive networks like some WiFi in banks or coffee shops or even some telco operator networks with restrictive NAT rules.

### Problem description:
Slack's nebula (mesh network uses UDP communication and hole punching technology to establish peer to peer communication between nodes in the mesh. But if there is a restriction and UDP cannot be used nebula itself is not working anymore.

### Trying to create a working solution:
Our shieldoo mesh is referencing nebula packages - we are not using binaries; what I have in mind is this construct:
* Create an underlaying connection on WebSocket (WSS - SSL based) to some "proxy" server and ship UDP communication there.
* Create the first underlying nebula mesh only between client and lighthouse.
* Use this underlying mesh and lighthouse "default gateway" for internet traffic.
* Then, a regular instance of the nebula process starts, and communication will be routed via the underlying network.

### Few challenges:
* How to configure AWS Application Load Balancer and Ingress controller in EKS to handle WebSockets properly?
* How to create correct routing rules in the operating system on the client-side?
